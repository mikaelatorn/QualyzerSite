            Part of our data will come from an interview with Linda Rising, the
            author of a book on introducing change. In the Project Explorer, right-click on
            on the project (Introducing Change) and select <code>New | Participant</code>.
            For <code>Participant ID</code>, enter <strong>linda</strong> and for full name,
            <strong>Linda Rising</strong>. Click Finish. A <em>Participant Editor</em> will
            open showing information about the new participant.

          You will now create a transcript for an interview with Linda Rising.
          First, download <a title="SE Radio interview with Linda Rising" href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/seradio/seradio-episode139-
            lindaRisingFearlessChange.mp3">this interview audio file</a> and put it on your
          desktop (if you cannot access the file, you can use any MP3 file on your
          computer).
        </p>


        <p>
          Right-click on the Project Explorer and select <code>New |
            Transcript</code>. Under Transcript name, enter
          <strong>Interview with Linda</strong>. For date, enter
          <strong>6/30/2010</strong>. Then select <strong>Linda</strong>
          from the list of participants. Next to the <code>Audio
            File</code> field, click on the <code>Browse</code> button,
          and navigate to the file
          <strong>seradio-episode139...</strong> that you just
          saved. Click <strong>Open</strong>. When you are done, click
          <strong>Finish</strong> to create the transcript.
        </p>


        <p>
          At this point the name of the transcript will appear in the Project
          Explorer and a <em>Transcript Editor</em> will open for this transcript. To
          listen to the interview, click on the play button (green arrow). Use the slider,
          stop, pause, and seek buttons to navigate through the interview.

          If the transcript editor is not open, open it by double-clicking on the
          transcript "Interview with Linda" in the project explorer. Use the slider or type the time
          directly into the current time slot next to the slider to
          position the file at <strong>5:52</strong>. This is the beginning of the
          interview. Play the next few seconds, until the male voice is done speaking.
          Then press pause. Type what you heard, which should be "Interviewer: OK, so I
          guess before we get started it's time Linda for you to introduce yourself."
        </p>

        <p>
          When some words are hard to hear, it can be useful to
          backtrack a few seconds to hear this again. If this is the
          case, use the back-seek button (blue left arrow).
        </p>
      </div>
        <p class="explain" style="margin-top:2rem;">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> If you find the default seek time (3 seconds) is not comfortable for
          you, you can change it by selecting <code>File | Preferences | Qualyzer
            Preferences</code>, and changing the number in the <code>Seek time</code> to the
          desired number of seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Double-click on the word "Interviewer". This will select
          it. Click on the "Bold" button in the toolbar (the letter
          B). In general, you can format any part of the text by selecting
          it and choosing any of the formatting options (bold, underline,
          italics) in the menu bar.
        </p>

        <p class="explain">
          To format text, you can also right-click on your selection and select a
          formatting option in the context menu or press the corresponding keyboard
          shortcut (<strong>Ctrl-B</strong>, <strong>Ctrl-I</strong>, and <strong>Ctrl-U</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
          You can continue transcribing Linda's answer. For the remaining part
          of the tutorial, you only need to transcribe this part: "Linda: Ok, thank you
          Marcus and thank you for recording this because I know anytime I do an interview
          with you and it goes live. I get email from all over the world so you must have
          an incredible audience. And they also... "I heard you on Software Engineering
          Radio". How exciting!"
        </p>

        <h3>Exploration Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Right-click in the project explorer and select <code>Import |
            Transcript</code>. Then, select a RTF file. You can create a RTF file by opening
            a Microsoft Word document and saving it as rtf. Alternatively, you can open
            WordPad, write some text, and save it.</li>

        <img src="images/tut5-6.png" width="546" height="490" alt="Qualyzer - Coding a Transcript" class="fl" />
        <p>
          You will now analyze the transcript by assigning <em>codes</em> to text
          fragments. Open the transcript "Interview with Linda". Select the following
          fragment "thank you Marcus", then right-click and select <code>Add Code</code>.
        </p>

        <p>A dialog will appear asking you for a code name. Enter "Thankful" in
          the code name and "feeling or expressing gratitude" in the description field.
          Click OK. The coded fragment will now be highlighted. If you hover the mouse
          over the fragment, you will see a tooltip with the code "Thankful".
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Instead of using the context menu to code a text
          fragment, you can simply press <strong>Ctrl-K</strong> (K for Kode) after having
          selected a fragment. If you don't like the highlighting color of coded
          fragments, go to <code>File | Preferences | Qualyzer Preferences</code> and
          click on the box labeled <strong>Marked Fragment Color</strong> to change the
          color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the next fragment "thank you for recording" and add the code
          you just created, i.e., "Thankful". Notice that when you start typing "t" in the
          code name, Qualyzer will offer you to automatically complete the code name with
          a list of existing codes beginning with the letters you just typed.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            Note that when creating a new code, Qualyzer will display a warning
            message at the top of the Add Code dialog as seen on the screenshot. When you
            enter an existing code, the warning is not displayed. This is to prevent you
            from creating a duplicate code with a spelling error (e.g., Thankful, thankful,
            and Thanksful).
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Finally, select the last text fragment, "How exciting!", and add the code you
          already created, "Thankful". Then, select the fragment by double-clicking
          anywhere in the fragment, and add a new code, "Enthusiasm". Once you have added
          a second code, notice that when you hover the mouse over the last fragment, the
          two codes are displayed in the tooltip.
        </p>
        <div class="explain">
          <p>
            Qualyzer does not allow fragments to overlap (e.g., "thank you Marcus"
            and "Marcus and thank you") and it is currently not possible to resize a
            fragment. The only workaround is to delete the codes associated with a fragment
            and code a new fragment. To delete all codes associated with a fragment,
            right-click on the fragment and select <code>Remove All Codes</code>. The
            fragment will no longer be highlighted.

          the codes that you can choose from. Select "Thankful" and press OK.
        </p>


        <p>
          A new editor entitled "View all fragments associated with code: Thankful" will open.
          In the editor, there is a section for each document containing a reference to Thankful. In each section,
          there is a text box for each coded fragment related to "Thankful": the coded fragment is underlined, like
          an hyperlink.
        </p>

        <p>
          Click on an underlined fragment. You will be brought back to the transcript editor and the fragment you

        <p>
          In this step, you will arrange your code in a hierarchy. Open the Code Editor by double-clicking on the
          "codes" node
          in the Project Explorer. On the left you will see a <em>list</em> containing all the codes in the project.
          On the right you will see an empty <em>hierarchy</em> representing the hierarchical relationships between
          the
          codes.
          Below these lists, there is a text area that displays the description of the currently selected code.
        </p>
        <!--
            <p class="explain">
            There are many actions available in the context menu's on both the List and the Hierarchy. These represent the 
            same sets of actions, but may have slightly different behaviors depending on where you call them from.
            </p>
            -->
        <p>
          You will create a new code that represents a good abstraction of the two codes you already have
          ("Enthusiasm"
          and "Thankful").
          Right-click on the list and select <code>New Code</code>. Fill in "Feelings" for the name.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create a hierarchy, start by dragging "Feelings" in the list and drop the code in the empty hierarchy.
          Then
          drag "Thankful"
          from the list to the hierarchy and drop it on "Feelings". Finally, save the code editor.
        </p>

        <div class="explain" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
          <p>
            The hierarchy represents a relationship between codes. The parent code will show its own frequency under
            <strong>Count</strong>
            and the total frequency of all its children and itself under <strong>Total</strong>. There are only a two
            restrictions when
            working with code hierarchies. First, Qualyzer prohibits cycles and duplicates in a hierarchy (e.g., you
            cannot add a second "Thankful"
            under "Feelings"). Second, a code can only be used once as a root. For example, "Feelings" cannot be the
            root of another hierarchy,
            but it can be used as a child in other hierarchies.

        <h3>Exploration Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try the <code>New Root Code</code> and <code>New Sub-Code</code> options in the Hierarchy context menu.
            Try to create
            more than one hierarchical level.</li>
          <li>Rename a code.</li>
          <li>Drag a code from the Hierarchy to another part of the hierarchy. Do this again while pressing Ctrl.</li>
          <li>Double-click on "Thankful" in either the list or the hierarchy.</li>
        </ul>
